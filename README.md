# Covid-19 Hospital Care #
### Time of project: May 2020
### Question: “How does the number of staffed hospital beds a state has affect the death rate of Covid-19?”
## Introduction:
### I read an article that suggested that mortality rate was heavily related with access to medical attention and hospital beds. In response, I attempted to see if there is a correlation between hospital bed access and mortality rate.

## Data set made up of three combined data sets:
###   -deaths/critical care/minimal care from corona/ state and day (IHME web page)
###   -number of staffed beds/ state (Statista web page)
###   -population/ state (worldometer web page)
