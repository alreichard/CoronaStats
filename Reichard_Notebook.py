# Andrea's homework'

# Quizzes are back!!

# Pair programming assignment: 
# With your partner, come up with something you want to do with one
# of the csv's on the web that would require a function you don't
# know.  Look it up on the web and accomplish your self-assigned task.
# 
# A few suggestions:
# * Make a legend on your plot
# * Create a different kind of plot (bar graph perhaps?)
# * Change the size of your tick marks

# # "How does the number of staffed hospital beds a state has affect the death rate of Covid-19?‚Äù
# 

# # First I read in my three data sets
# Element 1(Reading in a public data set):

# In[2]:



statepop = pd.read_csv("statepops.csv", delimiter=',')
statepop = statepop[['state','Unnamed: 12']] #Chose the two columns to use
statepop.rename({'Unnamed: 12': 'Population'}, axis=1, inplace=True) #renamed two columns
statepop.head(20)


# In[3]:


stafbeds = pd.read_csv("staffedbeds.csv", delimiter=',')

stafbeds.head(5)


# In[4]:


Hospit = pd.read_csv("Hospitalization_all_locs.csv", delimiter=',')
Hospit.head(5)


# The Hospit data set and statepop had extra elements that did not match up with the third data set, stafbeds:

# In[5]:


statepop=statepop.loc[statepop['state'].isin(stafbeds.State)] #separates all data that has the name of the states 
#in statepop that are also in stafbeds
statepop=copy.deepcopy(statepop) #copies the data frame with only the necessary rows indicated above, and creates a 
#new data set


# In[6]:


#Same thing as above but with Hospit states instead of statepop
Hospit=Hospit.loc[Hospit['location_name'].isin(stafbeds.State)]
Hospit=copy.deepcopy(Hospit)


# Hospit had all of its information by day for each state, so I had to make it the sum of the important data (all deaths from Covid-19 and all administered into the hospital for Covid-19). I also put the data into the same order as stafbeds to make it easier to add them to the same graph.

# In[7]:


mdeaths=[] #new blank array
for eachstate in stafbeds.State: #for loop 
    mdeaths.append(sum(Hospit.loc[(Hospit['location_name']==eachstate)].deaths_mean)) #takes agrigate of deaths_mean
    #as Hospit state equals the 'eachstate' from the for loop 


# In[8]:


#Does same as above but for 'admis_mean' (administered to the hospital)
adminis=[]
for eachstate in stafbeds.State:
    adminis.append(sum(Hospit.loc[(Hospit['location_name']==eachstate)].admis_mean))


# In[9]:


deathper=[] #blank array
for i in range(0,len(stafbeds.State)): #for loop, 'i' will equal each index in stafbeds 
    deathper.append((mdeaths[i]/adminis[i])*100) #devides two arrays created above 


# # statepop was also not in the same order, so I decided to test out a dictionary to get it in the same order

# Element 2: Dictionaries or panda data structures

# In[10]:


a =list(statepop.state)
b =list(statepop.Population) #creates two lists
state_lookup = {a[i]: b[i] for i in range(len(a))} #state name is the called upon key, Population is the value


# In[11]:


alphapop=[]   # creates an empty
for location in stafbeds.State: #for loop to run through all locations in stafbed states
    alphapop.append(state_lookup[location]) #appends values from the dictionary as the keys equals each 'location'


# In[55]:



stafbeds['Number of staffed beds'] = stafbeds['Number of staffed beds'].astype(int)
statepop['Population'] = statepop['Population'].astype(int) #changes columns into integer type
numbers_list = stafbeds['Number of staffed beds'].tolist()
empty_list = []
for x in range(len(alphapop)):
    adding = int(alphapop[x])/numbers_list[x]
    empty_list.append(adding)
    
    
stafbeds['People per Bed']= empty_list#adds new columns to stafbed


# Element 3: simulating a data set

# In[56]:


stafbeds['Death Percent']= deathper #adds deathper to stafbed
stafbeds.head(50)


# In[57]:


stafbeds['People per Bed'].corr(stafbeds['Death Percent'], method='pearson') #correlation of values


# Element 5: fitting a curve

# In[58]:


def func(x, a, b):
    return a*x + b #linear approximation equation
popt, pcov = curve_fit(func, stafbeds['People per Bed'], stafbeds['Death Percent'])
popt


# In[59]:


stafbeds['People per Bed'] = stafbeds['People per Bed'].astype(int) #Wasn't working without being set as int
comp = popt[0]*stafbeds['People per Bed']+popt[1] #taking best fit for a and b from linear equation
comp[0:3]#test


# Element 4: Plotting one parameter vs another and using the plot for analysis of some kind

# In[60]:


plt.plot(stafbeds['People per Bed'], stafbeds['Death Percent'], '.') #plot graph 
plt.xlabel("People per staffed hospital Bed")
plt.ylabel("Death % of Infected")
plt.title('State Death Rate')
plt.plot(stafbeds['People per Bed'], comp, '-') #best fit line


# Element 6: Using only a subset of the data that meet some criterion

# In[61]:


upper_death = np.percentile(stafbeds['Death Percent'], 94)#finds values in death percent that is in the 94th percentile
lower_death = np.percentile(stafbeds['Death Percent'], 6) #and 6th percentile
do = np.where((stafbeds['Death Percent'] < upper_death) & (stafbeds['Death Percent'] > lower_death))#stes perameters using 
#upper and lower deaths
plt.plot(stafbeds.loc[do]['People per Bed'], stafbeds.loc[do]['Death Percent'], '.') #plots new parameterized graph
plt.xlabel("People per Bed")
plt.ylabel("Death % of Infected")
plt.title('State Death Rate edited')



# It was a little strange that it had a negative correlation, so I checked to make everything was lined up right in the data. I took the location of each needed data point, and set it to the state Pennsyvania from its original data set. I then calculated the values by hand. They were equal to the staf bed values, so it is a correct graph. 

# Test suite:

# In[62]:


stafbeds.loc[do]['People per Bed'].corr(stafbeds.loc[do]['Death Percent'], method='pearson')


# In[63]:


sum(Hospit.loc[Hospit['location_name']=='Pennsylvania'].deaths_mean)


# In[64]:


sum(Hospit.loc[Hospit['location_name']=='Pennsylvania'].admis_mean)


# In[65]:


1707.3740000000003/11713.466532528999


# In[66]:


statepop.loc[statepop['state']=='Pennsylvania'].Population


# In[67]:


stafbeds.loc[stafbeds['State']=='Pennsylvania']['Number of staffed beds']


# In[68]:


12801989/35762


# # Why I think the correlation is negative:

# The correlation is negative, meaning that the more people per medically staffed bed the state, the lower the mortality rate. This is contradictory to what I thought it would look like.
# My theory: The y value is not depended on the x value. They are both indpendent, but come from the same trend. In general places that are more prone to injury or sickness (possibly due to high density of people) will need more staffed hospital beds in general to deal with the high number of sickness/injury. The corona virus is no different, so states more "prone" to sickness are also the same states that are prepared with more staffed beds.
